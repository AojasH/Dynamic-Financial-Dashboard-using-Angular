# Financial Application

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.12.

# Motivation
Application created as a means of putting into practice what I learned with Alura's TypeScript and Angular courses.

# Goal
Create an application that the user can manage their finances in a simple and clear way, without many configuration parameters like the applications on the market. 

# TO-DO

* Create unit tests
* Improve application accessibility 
* Create light theme
* Create .NET backend

## Dev

* Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
* Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
